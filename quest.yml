title: IronComponents 2
description: "Now that the setup is out of the way, it's time to actually start using styled components! \n\nLet's refactor an existing component so we can get used to the syntax and compare it with our normal way of doing styles!"
summary: "Refactoring is an important part of any developers job. You might be wondering, why change something if it's not broken? \n\n Well, besides performance and other optimizations, sometimes teams decide to either adopt new technologies or future-proof their work so they don't have to do a massive overhaul later. No one wants that! \n\nWe're going to start refining some of our older components to adopt this new library and in the future we'll use it on any new component."
